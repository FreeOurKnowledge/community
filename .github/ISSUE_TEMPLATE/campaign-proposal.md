Thanks for proposing a new collective action campaign for Project FOK! Campaigns should follow the general format: "When X researchers have signed this campaign, they will all do Y together", where X is a target number of people and Y is a specific action that they plan to take. If your campaign doesn't fit this format, please get in touch with the project team to discuss.

  Instructions:
  1. Add your campaign title in the Title field above ^
  2. Fill in as much of the below as you can, leaving question marks wherever you're unsure about something (these can be updated later as the details are worked out). Also feel free to delete any parts that aren't relevant. Note that the text between the arrows will not show up in the new issue. 
  3. Finally, when you're happy with everything click 'Submit new issue'... and let your friends/colleagues know about your new campaign!

  Brief description of why this campaign is needed (try to be succinct) ---> 
* Rationale: ?

<!---
  What is the action that signatories will carry out (e.g. upload one dataset)? Ideally this should be public in some way, so we can monitor compliance after pledges activate. If there's any further details you'll need to also specify them here (e.g., a list of boycotted/whitelisted journals). --->
* Action: ?

<!---
  Describe if there are any constraints on who can sign the pledge (e.g. only researchers in a particular field): --->
* Eligibility criteria: ?

<!---
  Will signatories have the option to remain anonymous prior to their pledge activating? (note that all names are made public once the campaign reaches threshold, irrespective of this setting) --->
* Optional anonymity: yes/no?

<!---
  What is the critical mass of signatures that will trigger the pledges to activate (e.g. 100)? --->
* Threshold: ?

<!---
  Will the action be carried out for a particular duration (e.g., boycott certain journals for 2 years)? Otherwise, if this field is irrelevant (e.g., the pledge relates to a single action) you can just delete this part --->
* Pledge duration: ?
