Project Free Our Knowledge is a collective action platform aiming to address cultural inertia in the adoption of open science practices and tools. In brief, researchers will be able to sign onto our platform and pledge to change their behaviour in line with various campaigns (e.g. publish/review exclusively in open access journals), but only act on their pledge when a predefined threshold of support is met in their research field. This strategy is designed to mitigate risks to vulnerable sectors of the community (e.g. early-career researchers, who are disincentivized from publishing in new journals due to their low impact factors) and to â€˜kickstart' support for initiatives that could benefit from a critical mass of researcher input.
