Project Free Our Knowledge is a collective action platform for researchers, which aims to accelerate progress in academia by organising collective action in support of open science practices. Using our website, researchers can make anonymous pledges to support particular behaviours if and when a critical mass of support for that behaviour is met in the community. Then – once the pre-determined number of pledges is reached – everyone is listed on the website and directed to carry out the action together. By acting in unison, we hope to motivate cultural change without placing individual careers at risk (for more info please see the [About page](https://freeourknowledge.org/about/) on our website).
