Project Free Our Knowledge is a new collective action platform for researchers, which aims to accelerate progress in academia by organising collective action on open science practices. Using our website, researchers can make anonymous pledges to support particular behaviours if and when a critical mass of support for that behaviour is met in the community. Then – after the pre-determined number of pledges is reached – everyone will be advertised on the website and directed to carry out the action together. By acting in unison, we hope to motivate cultural change without placing individual careers at risk. For more information, please see the About page on our website.
