### 30 Second Elevator (aka [Gaddie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lzj9aqfw4U) Pitch

1. You know how most researchers know that academia is unfair and exploitative, but feel they need to keep 'playing the game' lest they fall behind the pack?
2. Well, what we do is organise a critical mass of researchers to adopt new behaviours together, so that they can create positive cultural change without risk to individual careers
3. In fact, we have over 200 change-makers registered on our platform and are in the process of developing new collective action campaigns to put out to the crowd... (this should really be some kind of success, which we don't have yet!)
