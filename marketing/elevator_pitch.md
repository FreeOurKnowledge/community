### 30 Second Elevator (aka [Gaddie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lzj9aqfw4U)) Pitch

1. You know how most researchers know that academia is unfair and exploitative, but keep on 'playing the game' so that they don't fall behind the pack?
2. Well, what we do is organise a critical mass of researchers to adopt new behaviours *together*, so that we can create positive cultural change without placing individual careers at risk
3. In fact, we already have over 200 change-makers registered on our platform and are in the process of developing new collective action campaigns to put out to the crowd... (this should really be some kind of success, which we don't have yet!)
