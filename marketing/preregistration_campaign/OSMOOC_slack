Hi @everyone, FYI our Preregistration Pledge campaign is live and accepting pledges on Project Free Our Knowledge! :tada:

This is our newest campaign and asks you to complete just one preregistration within 2 years, after 100 people in your field have signed the same pledge. What is preregistration? It just means to record your hypotheses and analysis plans prior to conducting the research -- in other words, just good science! Why isn't it the norm already? Unfortunately, many individuals who might want to preregister face opposition (e.g., from supervisors) or might worry that they are losing their competitive edge by restricting their publication/analysis options (which can, sadly, include questionable research practices). By acting together, we can stand united in support of better scientific practice, mitigate career risks to individuals who want to do the right thing, and show support to vulnerable researchers who don't feel they can act on their own.

Currently Psychology is in the lead (34 signatures), but it's not too late to help make your field the first to reach 100 pledges. Once we get 100 pledges in a particular field, we'll list everyone's name on the website, contact them to let them know they have 2 years to submit a preregistration, and then tick off their name as they complete the pledge. We're starting small with this campaign, but hope to build on its success with bigger and bolder campaigns down the track. See how your field is going on the campaign page and help us get to the 100 person target by pledging today! :fist::people_holding_hands:
