Hi all, inviting you to take the Preregistration Pledge on Project FOK. We're now up to 32 pledges for the field of Psychology, 11 for Neuroscience and Neurobiology, 5 for both Metascience and Education, and 4 for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (among others) :tada: 

Once we get 100 pledges in a particular field, we'll list everyone's name on the website, contact them to let them know they have 2 years to preregister a single study, and then tick off everyone's name as they complete their pledge. Our goal with this campaign is to normalise preregistration in academia and (hopefully) set the stage for bigger and bolder campaigns down the track. If you support preregistration and the idea of working together to reform academia, please help us get to the 100 person target in your field by pledging today! :fist::people_holding_hands:
