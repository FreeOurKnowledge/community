Hi all, just bringing your attention to a new collective action campaign we're running on Free Our Knowledge: the Preregistration Pledge ðŸŽ‰ This campaign asks you to pledge to preregister a single study, along with 100 of your peers: https://freeourknowledge.org/2020-12-03-preregistration-pledge/

What is preregistration? It just means to record your hypotheses and analysis plans prior to conducting the research (in other words, just good scientific practice!) and helps to improve reliability, mitigate questionable research practices, foster collaboration and reduce wasted resources. 

Why is this campaign needed? Preregistration is still the exception in most fields, in large part due to cultural inertia that disincentivises straying from the norm. By acting together, we can demonstrate our desire to do better science, mitigate risks to individuals who want to do the right thing, and support vulnerable researchers who don't feel they can act on their own.

See the campaign page for more information, including how your field is progressing (Psychology is currently in the lead with 34 signatures). Please help us make preregistration the norm by pledging today! ðŸ‘«ðŸ™Œ
