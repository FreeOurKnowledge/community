Hi all, inviting you to join our new collective action campaign on Free Our Knowledge: the Preregistration Pledge! ðŸŽ‰ This campaign asks you to pledge to preregister a single study, along with 100 of your peers: https://freeourknowledge.org/2020-12-03-preregistration-pledge/
Why is this campaign needed? Preregistration is still the exception rather than the rule, in large part due to cultural inertia that disincentivises straying from the norm. By acting together, we can demonstrate our desire to do better science, mitigate risks to individuals who want to do the right thing, and support vulnerable researchers who don't feel they can act on their own.
Please see the campaign page for more information, including how the different fields are progressing (Psychology is currently in the lead with 48 signatures! ðŸ™Œ). Join us in normalising preregistration by pledging today! ðŸ‘«
