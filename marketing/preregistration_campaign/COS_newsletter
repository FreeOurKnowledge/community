Call to sign the Preregistration Pledge on Project Free Our Knowledge
Our partner organisation Free Our Knowledge (FOK) has launched a new collective action campaign asking researchers to preregister their next study, along with a cohort of their peers. Pledges are broken down by field, meaning that you will only be asked to take action once 100 people in your field have signed the same pledge. By acting together, FOK aims to build momentum for change while supporting individuals who don't feel powerful enough to act alone. Join the growing community of change-makers and help make preregistration the norm by pledging today!
