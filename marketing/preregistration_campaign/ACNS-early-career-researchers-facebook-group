Hi all, just extending an invitation to join our newest campaign on Project Free Our Knowledge, the Preregistration Pledge: https://freeourknowledge.org/2020-12-03-preregistration-pledge/
For the uninitiatied, Preregistration just means to register your study and analysis plans prior to conducting the research -- i.e., just good science! It's already the norm in some fields (e.g., medicine) but in our field is still very much the exception. And because there's such pressure on ECRs to 'publish or perish', it seems likely this culture will change very slowly unless we start unifying around principles we believe in. 
By acting together, we're hoping to demonstrate our support for better research practices, accelerate progress, and support vulnerable researchers who don't feel they can act on their own. 
If we reach 100 pledges in the field of Neuroscience, we'll all take action together and preregister a single study in the next 2 years (if we don't reach 100 pledges, no further action is required). Check out the campaign page for more information. Psychology is currently in the lead with 60 signatures, but with your support we could become the first field to reach 100 signatures and demonstrate this concept in action! ðŸ‘«âœŠðŸ“£
