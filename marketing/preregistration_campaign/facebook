Calling all scientists! 👩‍🔬🧪🧫🔬🧬⚗️🧠🔭🧑‍🔬

We need your help to get our Preregistration Pledge campaign over the line: https://freeourknowledge.org/2020-12-03-preregistration-pledge/ 💪

Preregistration is a time-stamped, publicly available document that researchers use to specify their research objectives, hypotheses, protocols and analyses prior to beginning a study -- basically just good scientific practice! But because it's not incentivised under the current system, we need to act together if we're going to make it the norm without punishing those who do the right thing.

Our Preregistration Pledge asks you to commit to preregistering just one study in the next two years, alongside 100 people in your field. If/when we reach this threshold in a particular field, we'll list everyone who has pledged on our website, contact them to let them know their pledge is now active, and progressively tick off each person's name as they complete their preregistration. In the future, we can then build on this small-scale success to host ever-larger campaigns as we collectively normalise Preregistration (and other Open Science practices) throughout academia.

So, if you support preregistration and want to help kickstart progress in academia, please take one minute and sign the pledge today: https://freeourknowledge.org/2020-12-03-preregistration-pledge/. Together we can fix academia. 

Thanks for your time and support (please share)!
