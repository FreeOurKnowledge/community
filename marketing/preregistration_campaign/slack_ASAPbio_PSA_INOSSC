Hi all, inviting you to take the Preregistration Pledge on Project Free Our Knowledge :tada: 

This campaign asks you to pledge to complete a single preregistration, within 2 years of the time that 100 people in your field have signed the same pledge. If we get 100 pledges in a particular field (Psychology is currently in the lead, with 35 pledges), we'll post everyone who has pledged on the website and let them know that their pledge is now active. If we don't reach 100 pledges, you don't need to take any further action (but you can if you like anyway, of course!). By acting together, we aim to send a strong signal in favour of open science practices, and protect those individuals who feel too vulnerable to create change on their own. In the future, we can then build on these small-scale successes to host ever-larger campaigns in support of open science practices.

If you support preregistration, help make it the norm in your field by taking the pledge today! :pencil::woman-raising-hand::man-raising-hand::woman-raising-hand::man-raising-hand::woman-raising-hand:
