Hi all, reaching out to seek support for our Preregistration Pledge campaign on Project Free Our Knowledge :pray:

We started developing this campaign during OLS-2 last year, using our Github repo, and have since posted it to our shiny new Github Pages website (thanks for all the skillz OLS! :tada:). This campaign asks you to pledge to complete just one preregistration, within 2 years of the time that 100 people in your field make the same pledge. If we get 100 pledges in a particular field, we will post everyone who has pledged on the website and let them know that their pledge is now active (but if we don't get to 100 pledges, you don't need to do anything). By acting together, we aim to send a strong signal in favour of open science practices, and protect those individuals who feel too vulnerable to create change on their own. In the future, we plan to build on these small-scale campaigns to host ever-larger campaigns in support of open science practices.

Be a change-maker and take the pledge today! :woman-raising-hand::man-raising-hand::woman-raising-hand::man-raising-hand::woman-raising-hand:
