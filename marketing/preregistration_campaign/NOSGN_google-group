Hi all, 

I'm writing to seek your support in promoting our new Preregistration Pledge campaign on Project Free Our Knowledge (FOK) within your networks. This campaign asks researchers to preregister a single study, if and when 100 people in their research field have taken the same pledge. Our goal with this campaign is to normalise preregistration in academia, while protecting and empowering vulnerable individuals who don't feel powerful enough to act alone.

We currently have 48 pledges in Psychology, so are well on our way to the 100 pledge target in that field at least (see tallies for other fields on the campaign page), but could really use your help in bringing us over the line. Once we get 100 pledges in any one field, we'll list everyone's name on the website, contact them to let them know their pledge is now active, and then link to everyone's preregistration as they complete their pledge. In the future, we hope to build on this smallscale success to host ever-larger and bolder campaigns that seek to align academia with researchers' interests (if you'd like to design new campaigns, please do so here).

It would mean a great deal if you could please promote this campaign in any way possible within your open science networks. Feel free to draft your own text, borrow materials from our Github repo, or contact me to let me know what channels you have available (e.g., Twitter, newsletter, Slack etc) and I'll happily draft up some text for you to use. And of course, if you feel comfortable, take the pledge yourself (if you haven't already!) :)

Thanks for your time and I look forward to creating change with all of you.


Kind regards,
Dr Cooper Smout (founder)
