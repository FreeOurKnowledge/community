Calling all scientists! 👩‍🔬🧪🧫🔬🧬⚗️🧠🔭🧑‍🔬

Do you think there are better ways we could be doing science, but don't feel comfortable creating that change on your own? Well now you don't have to! We are creating a union of scientists who act together to overcome collective action problems in science, from corporate ownership of the literature to unreliable research practices.

Our newest campaign asks you to preregister a single study, alongside a critical mass of your peers. For the uninitiated, preregistration means to declare your research objectives, hypotheses, protocols and analyses prior to beginning a study -- basically just good science! But because it's not rewarded under the current system, we need to act together to make it the norm without punishing individuals. For this campaign, you will only act if and when 100 people in your field have taken the pledge, at which point we will advertise the pledges and direct everyone to carry out their pledge in unison. 

Read more about the campaign and take the pledge today: https://freeourknowledge.org/2020-12-03-preregistration.../ 
Together we can fix academia  💪 (please share!)
