There are many ways you can get involved with the project, beyond pledging to campaigns and sharing them with your friends and colleagues:

* *Join our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dFVBVz)* to stay informed as we develop the project.
* *Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectfok) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/)* 
* *Develop new campaigns*. You can propose new campaigns on our [Github repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adraft-campaign) by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/new/choose), or help others develop their proposals by commenting on existing issues marked 'draft-campaign'.
* *Donate/share our crowdfunding campaign*. We are a researcher-driven initiative and currently 100% self-funded. If you can afford a few dollars to sponsor our platform development, or would be willing to share to your networks, please do so [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/rpjkz-test). 
* *Become an ambassador*. We're looking for people who can help spread the word to friends and colleagues within their institutions and research fields (e.g. via presentations, social media, and casual discussions). 
* *Communications and marketing*. We're looking for skilled communicator/s who can help spread the word about this project (e.g. via social media, blogs, articles, and advertising).
* *Software development*. There's plenty to do on both the front- and back-end software development, please get in touch if you have skills in this department.
* *UX design*. The current platform is in a minimal viable product state, and we're looking for collaborators to help redesign and develop the user experience (coded in Jekkyl for Github Pages). 
* *Metascience*. As the data comes in, it will be useful to analyse it along various dimensions to gauge community support (e.g. researcher career-level, country, institution, etc.). These analyses will then be displayed on the website and contribute to publications and blogs describing the platform usage.
* *Data management*. We're anticipating collecting large numbers of pledges with this project and need to keep that information confidential but also amenable to various analyses. As such, we're looking for people with experience organising and securing confidential data.
