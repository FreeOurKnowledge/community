### Project Free Our Knowledge: Accelerating Open Science with Collective Action Campaigns

Session leads: Cooper Smout
Length: 1.5 hours.
Pre-requisites: None.

Abstract: Open Science practices benefit the entire research community but can also come at a personal cost to individuals who adopt them (e.g. in time, resources, or high impact publications). Project Free Our Knowledge aims to mitigate this conflict by organising collective action in the academic community. Researchers will be able to pledge to adopt a particular Open Science practice (e.g. Open Access publishing, pre-registration), subject to there being a personally-selected threshold of support in the research community (quantified using citation counts). In this unconference I will present details of the project, launch the new platform, and open up a discussion on potential campaigns and strategies to advance the initiative.
