Gabe Stein, Cooper Smout
discussion time ~1hr

* Gabe has a product development background
* Cooper/Gabe to arrange ~monthly catchup
* 3 core themes Knowledge Futures Group has discussed with funders:
  * validation (reviews, meta-reviews)
  * governance model -- funders generally want to establish gov structure first, KFG has had some success pitching that they support communities first, then develop structure
  * fixed percentage of publishing costs (e.g. 1%) diverted to open infrastructure, e.g. Michael Eisen original idea leading to PLOS
* KFG planning space/workshops/hackathon for discussing progressive publishing ideas (~November)
